# Musical-Beeps
A program created in Python 2.7 to play music using Windows beeps.
Run homefile.py.
(This will run in Python 2, needs minor tweaks for Python 3)

This project is something very unique that I created 9 years ago from now, in the year 2015.

When I was in class 11th, we used to go to computer lab and annoy people by playing beeps using Winsound module in python.
I was playing around with it and discovered that we can use it inside loops (I was a kid back then) ðŸ˜‚

Since I am a bedroom pianist and guitarist, my first thought was "why can't I figure out the frequency of different notes"
It took me 1-2 months to complete my hit and trial and now the real challenge was managing the timing between the notes..

Managed to write logic to play 2-3 songs. :)
